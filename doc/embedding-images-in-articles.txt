Embedding images in articles:

	Rationale:

		The "fulltext" of the article is converted to html following the Markdown
		markup-language. Markdown offers a method of embedding images but it is
		cumbersome and not easily integrated with the database. Therefore we
		offer image embedding through a custom syntax.

	Syntax:

		Images can be embedded by inserting the following anywhere in the
		fulltext of the article:

			[[image-slug]]

		This will render to something like:

			########################
			#                      #
			#                      #
			#      IMAGE HERE      #
			#                      #
			#                      #
			########################
			                 Authors
			Caption here.

		The image will be scaled to the exact size of the box.

		Options for the images (see bottom for list) can be specified as:

			[[option1:option2:image-slug]]

		Note that the image must be associated with the article (selected
		in the article's "images" field) to be eligible for auto-embedding.

	Examples:

		[[diagram]]
		[[thumb:track]]
		[[left:small:nexus-logo]]

		... Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.
		[[buffalo-image]]
		Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo...

	By default the image takes up the whole page width and has its caption
	and attribution included below it.

	Adjust the position and size of the image:

		small  -  limits image width to ~1/2 the page; text wraps around
		thumb  -  shows thumbnail with no caption or attribution
		left   -  float image at left, only affects small/thumb images

	Override display settings:

		noscale       -  don't stretch image (use for non-photographic images)
		clear         -  disallow horizontally adjacent images (buggy in IE6)
		nocaption     -  hide caption
		noattr        -  hide attribution
		showcaption   -  show caption
		showattr      -  show attribution
		noborder      -  no image border

Embedding images in articles:

	Rationale:

		The "fulltext" of the article is converted to html following the Textile
		markup-language. Textile offers a method of embedding images but it is
		cumbersome and not easily integrated with the database. Therefore we
		offer image embedding through a custom syntax.

	Syntax:

		Images can be embedded by inserting the following anywhere in the
		fulltext of the article:

			[[image-slug]]

		This will render to something like:

			########################
			#                      #
			#                      #
			#      IMAGE HERE      #
			#                      #
			#                      #
			########################
			                 Authors
			Caption here.

		Options for the images (see bottom for list) can be specified as:

			[[option1:option2:image-slug]]

		Note that the image must be associated with the article (selected
		in the article's "images" field) to be eligible for auto-embedding.

	Examples:

		[[solar-eclipse]]
		[[left:small:nexus-logo]]
		[[thumb:track]]
		[[fill-black:center:dark-diagram]]

		... Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.
		[[buffalo-image]]
		Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo...

	By default the image takes up the whole page width and has its caption
	and attribution included below it.

	Change the position and size of the image:

		small  -  limits image width to 1/3 the page; text wraps around
		thumb  -  shows thumbnail with no caption or attribution
		left   -  float image at left, only affects small/thumb images

		Taller images fit better with the small option.
		Logos/non-photos work well with the thumb option.
	
	Use the following if the image isn't wide enough to fill the box:

		stretch     -  stretch image to fill box, preserving aspect ratio
		center      -  center image in box (left-aligned by default)
		fill-black  -  fill empty space in box with black (white by default)
